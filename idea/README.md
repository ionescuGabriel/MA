Project Idea:

Description: The project will consist of an android application that will aid the user in managing and rating musical albums that the user has listened to and to mark other albums for future listening. The user will be able to add, remove and update albums and also rate them or otherwise to tag them for future listening. The albums will be displayed as a list with a few fields visible from the main screen and more information will be displayed when the user selects one of the albums present.<br />
Entry details: Each album entry will containt the name, artist, user rating, release year, genre and the listened to tag.<br />
CRUD details:<br />
> Create: Firstly, the user will be able to add albums which will consist of filling the following fields: the name, the artist name, the genre and the release year. The user will also have the option to give a one to ten rating in this step and to confirm having listened to the album to be created or to tag it for future listening.<br />
> Read: From the main list of albums which will display the album names and a few more fields the user can select one to see a screen that displays all the fields of that album. Here the user will also have the option to update or delete the entry.<br />
> Update: The user will be able to update the fields of the album and also add or modify its rating or change its status once the user has listened to it.<br />
> Delete: When the user opts to delete an entry he will be shown a confirmation dialog where he can proceed with the deletion or cancel it.<br />
<br />
Persistence: The app will persist a sequence of the three previous operations the user has executed (create, update or delete).<br />
Offline detail: When the user is offline and tries to do an operation he will be notified that the modifications are not being sent to the server and will be persisted locally.
